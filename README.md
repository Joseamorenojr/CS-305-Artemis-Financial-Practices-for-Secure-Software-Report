# CS-305-Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report
Artemis Financial, a company focused on managing sensitive financial data, needed help identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in its web application. To meet their needs, I implemented Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption for data protection, SHA-256 for checksum verification, and enabled secure communications using HTTPS with self-signed certificates through Java Keytool. I conducted thorough vulnerability assessments using OWASP Dependency-Check and confirmed that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during refactoring. Coding securely is critical because it protects sensitive data, maintains client trust, prevents compliance violations, and strengthens the overall resilience of an application. One of the more challenging yet helpful parts of this project was performing static vulnerability assessments and ensuring secure cryptographic practices. To increase security layers, I combined strong encryption algorithms, secure transport protocols, and dependency management practices. In the future, I would continue using industry-standard tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and integrate dynamic analysis tools to further improve security assessments. I verified the functionality and security of the application through functional and static testing, ensuring that new vulnerabilities were not introduced during updates. Resources such as NIST guidelines, Iron-Clad Java practices, and OWASP tools proved invaluable and will be beneficial for future assignments. From this project, I can present future employers with examples of secure code refactoring, vulnerability assessment reports, and successful implementation of industry-standard best practices.
